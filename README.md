`persisted` is a Rust library that makes it easy and quick to save arbitrary program state. Its simple and flexible design means you bring your own data store. You tell `persisted` how to save data and what you want to save, and it figures out the rest.

For examples, see the `examples/` directory or the [documentation](https://docs.rs/persisted).
